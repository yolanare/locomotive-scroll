# Attributes

## data-scroll

Enable viewport detection on an element.

Here's an example of using Locomotive Scroll's data-scroll attribute on an HTML element:

```html
<div data-scroll></div>
```

## data-scroll-position

-   **Type:** `string`
-   **Default:** `start,end`

![Data Scroll Position](/assets/data-scroll-position.jpg)

This attribute specifies the trigger position of the element within the viewport when using the Locomotive Scroll library. It accepts two values: one for the position when the element enters the viewport, and a second for the position when the element leaves the viewport.

Accepted values are: `'start'`, `'middle'`, `'end'`.

### Examples

Here's an example of using Locomotive Scroll's data-scroll-position attribute on an HTML element:

```html
<div data-scroll data-scroll-position="start, start"></div>
```

## data-scroll-offset

-   **Type:** `string`
-   **Default:** `0,0`

![Data Scroll Offset](/assets/scroll-offset-1.jpg)

Specifies the trigger offset of the element within the viewport when using the Locomotive Scroll library. It takes two values: one for the offset when the element enters the viewport, and a second for the offset when the element leaves the viewport.

The offset can be defined in two ways:

-   If specified in percentages, it is relative to the viewport height.
-   If specified in pixels, it is an absolute value.

For example:

-   `'100,50%'` represents an offset of `100` pixels for the enter position and `50%` of the viewport height for the leave position.
-   `'25%, 15%'` represents an offset of `25%` of the viewport height for the enter position and `15%` of the viewport height for the leave position.

### Example

Here's an example of using Locomotive Scroll's data-scroll-offset attribute on an HTML element:

```html
<div data-scroll data-scroll-offset="400, 200"></div>
```

## data-scroll-class

-   **Type:** `string`
-   **Default:** `is-inview`

Specifies a custom class to be applied to the element when its offset intersects with the viewport. The default class used is `is-inview`.

You can provide your own class name as a string value to customize the styling or behavior of the element when it becomes visible within the viewport.

## data-scroll-repeat

Specifies whether the element's in-view detection should repeat if it is declared.

By default, the in-view detection of elements is not repeated. **Simply declaring this attribute will enable the repeat behavior for in-view detection of the element.**

## data-scroll-speed

-   **Type:** `number`

Specifies the parallax speed for the element. A negative value will reverse the direction of the parallax effect.

Note: The value represents the translation of the element relative to the scrolling. For example, if the value is `1`, it means that for every 1px scrolled, the element translates by 1px. If the value is `.5`, it means that for every 1px scrolled, the element translates by 0.5px.

## data-scroll-call

-   **Type:** `string`

The `data-scroll-call` attribute enables you to trigger a custom event when an element becomes visible within the viewport. This attribute requires a string value that specifies the name of the custom event that you want to trigger.

By utilizing the `data-scroll-call` attribute, you can define and trigger your own events to perform specific actions or handle certain behaviors when elements scroll into view. These events can be listened to and handled in your JavaScript code using event listeners or any event handling mechanism provided by your framework or library.

Here's an example of how to use the `data-scroll-call` attribute:

```html
<div data-scroll data-scroll-call="scrollEvent">Trigger</div>
```

```js
window.addEventListener('scrollEvent', (e) => {
    const { target, way, from } = e.detail;
    console.log(`target: ${target}`, `way: ${way}`, `from: ${from}`);
});
```

## data-scroll-css-progress

If you declare this attribute, it will add a CSS variable `--progress` to the element. This variable represents the current progress of the element and ranges between `0` and `1`.

By adding `--progress` as a CSS variable, you can utilize it in your CSS styles to create dynamic effects or animations based on the scrolling progress of the element.

## data-scroll-event-progress

-   **Type:** `string`

When you declare this attribute, it will trigger the custom event that you specify. This event allows you to retrieve the current progress of the element, which ranges between `0` and `1`.

By utilizing the custom event, you can implement event handlers in your JavaScript code to perform actions or retrieve information based on the scrolling progress of the element.

```html
<div data-scroll data-scroll-event-progress="progressEvent">
    Progress custom event
</div>
```

```js
import LocomotiveScroll from 'locomotive-scroll';

const locomotiveScroll = new LocomotiveScroll();

window.addEventListener('progressEvent', (e) => {
    const { target, progress } = e.detail;
    console.log(`target: ${target}`, `progress: ${progress}`);
});
```

## data-scroll-to

Prevents the click event and initiates scrolling to a target. If the element is a link (`<a>`), it uses the `href` attribute as the target. Otherwise, if the element has the `data-scroll-to-href` attribute, it uses that as the target.

## data-scroll-to-href

-   **Type:** `string`

Specifies the target for the `data-scroll-to` action. If the element is a link, the `href` attribute is used as the target. Alternatively, you can specify a custom target using the `data-scroll-to-href` attribute.

## data-scroll-to-offset

-   **Type:** `number`

Specifies the scroll offset for the `data-scroll-to` action. The value is a number that represents the scroll padding top. It determines the vertical offset from the top of the target element when scrolling to it.

## data-scroll-to-duration

-   **Type:** `number`

Specifies the duration of the scroll animation for the `data-scroll-to` action. The value is a number representing the scroll duration in seconds. It determines how long the scrolling animation takes to reach the target element.

## data-scroll-ignore-fold

If an element is within the fold (visible portion of the viewport), its offset is automatically adjusted to start its progress from its starting position. However, if you want to ignore this default behavior and prevent the offset adjustment, you can use the `data-scroll-ignore-fold` attribute.

Please note that by using the `data-scroll-ignore-fold` attribute, the element's progress will not be influenced by its position within the fold, and its offset will remain unchanged throughout the scrolling process.

## data-enable-touch-speed

We disable the parallax effect when a touch event is detected by default. However, if you want to enable the parallax effect on touch devices, you can use the `data-enable-touch-speed` attribute.

By adding this attribute to the element, you can override the default behavior and allow the parallax effect to be active even on touch devices. This allows for a consistent parallax experience across different types of devices.

Please note that enabling the parallax effect on touch devices may have implications for the user experience, as touch interactions and scrolling may behave differently compared to traditional mouse-based interactions. Use this attribute with caution and ensure that the parallax effect enhances the overall user experience on touch devices.
